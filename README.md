# AI Portfolio
This repository documents my structured progression across core areas of Artificial Intelligence. 
The focus is on practical, reproducible implementations of machine learning, deep learning, and NLP systems — 
with clean code, experiment tracking, and incremental skill development.

## Current Focus Areas
- Classical Machine Learning  
  (scikit-learn pipelines, feature engineering, model evaluation)
- Artificial Neural Networks & Deep Learning  
  (MLPs, optimization, regularization, Keras & PyTorch)
- Natural Language Processing  
  (text preprocessing, embeddings, transformer-based models)
- Model deployment and inference pipelines
- GPU-accelerated experimentation on local hardware

> Robotics-oriented AI is intentionally excluded.

## Project Structure
Projects are organized by topic and model family to clearly reflect conceptual progression:

```
ai-portfolio/
├── classical-machine-learning/
├── artificial-neural-networks/
├── deep-learning/
├── embeddings/
├── semantic-search/
└── model-deployment/
```

Each project contains:
- a clear problem statement
- model architecture and training details
- evaluation metrics
- implementation notes and limitations

## Roadmap (High-level)
- Establish strong classical ML baselines  
- Build and analyze feed-forward neural networks on tabular data  
- Move into embeddings and semantic search  
- Fine-tune transformer models (BERT / DistilBERT)
- Train and serve large language models locally (LoRA, quantization, efficient inference)
- Optimize training workflows on local GPU infrastructure
