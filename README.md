# AI Portfolio

This repository documents my structured progression across core areas of Artificial Intelligence. 
The focus is on practical, reproducible implementations of machine learning, deep learning, and NLP systems — 
with clean code, experiment tracking, and incremental skill development.

## Current Focus Areas
- Classical Machine Learning (scikit-learn pipelines, feature extraction, evaluation)
- Deep Learning fundamentals (PyTorch)
- Natural Language Processing (text preprocessing, embeddings, transformers)
- Model deployment and serving
- (Excluding robotics)

## Project Structure
- Coming Soon...

## Roadmap (High-level)

- Build strong classical ML baseline understanding ✅ In progress
- Move into embeddings and semantic search
- Fine-tune transformer models (BERT / DistilBERT)
- Train and serve LLMs locally (LoRA, quantization, inference pipelines)
- Optimize training workflows on local GPU infrastructure
